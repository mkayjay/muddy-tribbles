# Managing and growing evergreen notes
## Principles
### Status
Example statuses for evergreen notes:
- 🌱️ `#seed` | Seedling notes are empty notes you need to flesh out
	- I just create the note title, and then tag it with a seedling
- 🌿 `#sprout` | Sprouting ideas that need to be elaborated upon further
	- Can range from a few jot notes to an overall structure
- 🌲️ `#tree` | Tree notes which are ready to be part of your note forest
	- Already has connections with related notes
	- Can continue to nurture and grow as you continue to find more insights from content or new connections
