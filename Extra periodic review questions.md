# Extra periodic review questions
## Principles
Out of boredom, I went over my previous annual review for 2021 with a coworker

My recorded reflections are still relatable to now, makes me question whether I made much progress on my systems and mindset ðŸ˜…

But now, I've been looking into ways to spice it up, and started crafting an ideal annual review
