# Kanban Board
## Principles
- Kanban Boards act as visual aid to see which projects are in different stages of development
	- ex) Backlog, in progress, completed
- Control the flow of work
- Have limiting WIP projects to what is sustainable
### Kanban Token
- An object that dictates the work and holds information about work to be done
	- ex) A coffee cup will have size, name, and type of drink labelled, ready for barista to make
- In this case, our tokens are each kanban card

### Push vs Pull
- Push is a card that is moved after it is finished
- Pull is when something is moved only if it is ready to work on
	- Also pull if given a signal (empty supply of a certain ingredient)
- Make sure that the transition to the next stage is clear, when in doubt make a new column

## Benefits
- Visualized work
- Help identify bottlenecks
- Simple and reliable
