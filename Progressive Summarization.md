# Progressive Summarization
> [Article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/)
## Principles
- Like re-reading a book
- Progressive summarization establishes different tiers of summarizing depending on your use case
	- Helpful if you want to retain context and be able to quickly glance at main ideas
- Takes the 10% from highlights into 1% of densely packed information
- Reducing total notes lets the remaining shine
- Use the [[Progressive Summarization Checklist Addon]] to keep track of an input note's status
### When
- Space it out
- do progressive summarization like knitting, when you have time, nothing urgent
### Stages
- Captured notes
- Bolded passages
	- initially you may have taken notes to highlight table of contents, but next run just bold  
	- bold how the author explains things for when you have to share explanations in your outputs
- Highlighted passages
	- key words if you were to quickly skim and get the gist
	- can help connect far away things through yellow attention
- Executive summary
	- Bullet points to keep concise
