# QuickAdd Plugin
## Principles
- Each command you see in the QuickAdd command pallete (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) are called choices
- I think you need to disable and enable the command palette action (click lightning bolt twice) to make changes effective, or else embedded buttons won't work
### Creating a Choice
To create a choice:
1. Go to `Settings` -> `QuickAdd` -> `Manage Macros`
2. Insert macro name -> `Add macro` -> Configure
3. `Template` -> ⚙️ -> Fill out settings as desired
	- consider using the already-existing ones as a reference
	- to change the name, click on it
4. Go back to `QuickAdd Settings` -> Add choice of type `Macro`
5.  Move it under the respected multi-choice
