___
# ðŸ’­ There's too much content to consume
## Context
- 2:15 am typing this, trying to catch up on my reading lists
## Feelings
 - Overwhelmed?
 - Intrigued as I want to try and see how to optimize and solve it
## Thoughts
- There's just too much stuff to learn and take notes about
	- Newsletters
	- All my different interests
	- Books
	- Blogs on medium
	- Tweets
	- YouTube
	- Multipled because of each individual creator

**Did I learn anything?**
- Need to listen to my tweet, and only take notes/consume if I will genuinely use it in the future. Otherwise, I should just bookmark.
## Future Plan
- See above
- Work on being content with not consuming, and just to place the information somewhere where it will be useful
