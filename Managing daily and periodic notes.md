# Managing daily and periodic notes
## Principles
Periodic notes help me reflect on the current week/timeframe, then plan for the future one with projects

I added the Calendar plugin to make trying out the daily and weekly note templates easier.
- Just view the calendar pane on the right side-bar, and click on a date/week to automatically create a new nem, and check my [daily note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFFTIIUDNK4&ab_channel=JohnMavrick) and [periodic note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNfnkZDWhY&ab_channel=JohnMavrick) videos (outdated)
However, you will have to use the quickadd commands to create the other kinds.
## Daily Notes
See [[Template Explanations#Daily Note Template]]
## Periodic Review Notes
[[Vault Troubleshooting#^ch4g25|Make sure to set note titles with the proper format or else the templater commands won't work]]
- I personally do `Overview` and `Reflection` before I do `Future Plan` but I have it in top for easy reference
- Can create a new periodic note using QuickAdd commands
- View each kind of review timeframe in the respective note
- See [[Template Explanations#Periodic]] for more information on the content of the templates
- If the date templates output the wrong dates, see [[Vault Troubleshooting#Dates are incorrect in periodic reviews]]

Can also be a good place for [[Creating and tracking your own habits and statistics]]
### Weekly Review Template
> Most of the content is the same in other periodic notes, but modified to accomodate for the change in timeframes
