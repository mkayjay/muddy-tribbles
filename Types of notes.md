# Types of notes

## Guidelines
- Notes with the `#🔍` are mainly used as queries and will not include much information themselves
- [[Maps of Content (MOC)]] `#🗺️` are similar to query notes, but are

## Knowledge-Based Notes
- Can use [Andy Matuschak's Note Type Taxonomy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6f6xgGG4NKjkA5NA1kDd46whJh2Gt5rAmfX) as a reference
- Here are some example classifications on the kinds of notes you can write in your Second Brain:
	- Definition notes to clarify meaning
		- ex) [[Evergreen Notes]]
	- Declarative notes to prove a specific point
		- ex) [[Use resource summaries as a foundation for your own thinking and creating]]
	- Bridge notes to showcase similarities and differences between two kindred notes
		- ex) [[Ideation is an incremental, slow burn]]
	- Abstract notes to connect the above notes
		- Can be cultivated via [[💡 My Brainstorms]]
		- ex) This vault, the culmination of different [[Personal Knowledge Management MOC|PKM MOC]] workflows, ideas, and templates
## Personal notes
- For lack of a better method, I usually differentiate all personal notes from their more general counterparts ([[Kanban Board]] vs [[📌My Kanbans]]) with the `My` prefix
