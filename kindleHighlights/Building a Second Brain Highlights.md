Introduction

The Promise of a Second Brain
[2022-06-25 12:54 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/10/2/4/2/2%5Bintro_hd%5D/2%5Bpage_vi%5D%3A0%29)

--------------------

The Building a Second Brain system will teach you how to:

Find anything you’ve learned, touched, or thought about in the past within seconds.
Organize your knowledge and use it to move your projects and goals forward more consistently.
Save your best thinking so you don’t have to do it again.
Connect ideas and notice patterns across different areas of your life so you know how to live better.
Adopt a reliable system that helps you share your work more confidently and with more ease.
Turn work “off” and relax, knowing you have a trusted system keeping track of all the details.
Spend less time looking for things, and more time doing the best, most creative work you are capable of.

Benefits and solutions of a second brain

--------------------

Chapter 1

Where It All Started
Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.

What Is a Second Brain?
[2022-06-25 1:02 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/2%5Bch02_hd%5D/2%5Bpage_17%5D%3A0%29)

--------------------

According to the New York Times, **the average person’s daily consumption of information now adds up to a remarkable 34 gigabytes**.1 A separate study cited by the Times estimates that **we consume the equivalent of 174 full newspapers’ worth of content each and every day, five times higher than in 1986**.2
[2022-06-25 1:02 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/10/8%3A0%29)

We consume a lot of content. Every day.

--------------------

only 56 percent of the time are they able to find the information required to do their jobs.
[2022-06-25 1:03 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/14/1%3A340%29)

--------------------

Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household.
[2022-06-25 1:04 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/48/1%3A61%29)

--------------------

your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others. A studio where you can experiment with ideas until they are ready to be put to use in the outside world. A whiteboard where you can sketch out your ideas and collaborate on them with others.
[2022-06-25 1:04 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/50/1%3A30%29)

--------------------

For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

By this definition, a note could include a passage from a book or article that you were inspired by; a photo or image from the web with your annotations; or a bullet-point list of your meandering thoughts on a topic, among many other examples. A note could include a single quote from a film that really struck you, all the way to thousands of words you saved from an in-depth book. The length and format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note.
[2022-06-25 1:06 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/76/2%5Bpage_24%5D%3A182%29)

The natural variety of your notes

--------------------

So many of us share the feeling that we are surrounded by knowledge, yet starving for wisdom. That despite all the mind-expanding ideas we have access to, the quality of our attention is only getting worse.
[2022-06-25 1:09 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/108/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

As this way of working with information continues over days and weeks and months, the way your mind works begins to change. You start to see recurring patterns in your thinking: why you do things, what you really want, and what’s really important to you. Your Second Brain becomes like a mirror, teaching you about yourself and reflecting back to you the ideas worth keeping and acting on. Your mind starts to become intertwined with this system, leaning on it to remember more than you ever could on your own.
[2022-06-25 1:13 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/128/2%5Bpage_29%5D%3A0%29)

BASB helps change and learn more about yourself. It naturally becomes an extension of your own capabilities.

--------------------

There’s no need to wait until you’re perfectly prepared. No need to consume more information or do more research. All that’s left is for you to take action on what you already know and already have, which is laid out before you in meticulous detail.
[2022-06-25 1:14 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/132/1%3A170%29)

Your tiny snippets of learning from previous days eventually will come to fruition

--------------------

 This sense of confidence in the quality of your thinking gives you the freedom to ask deeper questions and the courage to pursue bigger challenges. You can’t fail, because failure is just more information, to be captured and used as fuel for your journey.
[2022-06-25 1:14 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/16/2/4/2/134/1%3A152%29)

Chapter 3

How a Second Brain Works
[2022-06-25 1:15 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/2%5Bch03_hd%5D/2%5Bpage_32%5D%3A0%29)

--------------------

Think of your Second Brain as the world’s best personal assistant.

It is perfectly reliable and totally consistent. It is always ready and waiting to capture any bit of information that might be of value to you. It follows directions, makes helpful suggestions, and reminds you of what’s important to you.
[2022-06-25 1:15 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/6/2/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to perform for us:

Making our ideas concrete.
Revealing new associations between ideas.
Incubating our ideas over time.
Sharpening our unique perspectives.
Let’s examine each of these.
[2022-06-25 1:16 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/16/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

By keeping diverse kinds of material in one place, we facilitate this connectivity and increase the likelihood that we’ll notice an unusual association.
[2022-06-25 1:23 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/40/2%5Bpage_36%5D%3A0%29)

connecting notes

--------------------

Quotes from a philosophy book written in ancient times might sit next to the latest clever tweet. Screenshots from an interesting YouTube video can live right by scenes from classic movies. An audio memo might be saved alongside project plans, a link to a helpful website, and a PDF with the latest research findings. All these formats can be combined in a way that would be impossible in the physical world.
[2022-06-25 1:23 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/42/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

Now imagine if you were able to unshackle yourself from the limits of the present moment, and draw on weeks, months, or even years of accumulated imagination.

I call this approach the “slow burn”—allowing bits of thought matter to slowly simmer like a delicious pot of stew brewing on the stove. It is a calmer, more sustainable approach to creativity that relies on the gradual accumulation of ideas, instead of all-out binges of manic hustle. Having a Second Brain where lots of ideas can be permanently saved for the long term turns the passage of time into your friend, instead of your enemy.
[2022-06-25 1:25 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/52/1%3A163%29)

--------------------

The first way that people tend to use their Second Brain is as a memory aid. They use their digital notes to save facts and ideas that they would have trouble recalling otherwise: takeaways from meetings, quotes from interviews, or the details of a project, for example.
[2022-06-25 1:31 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/94/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

Eventually, the third and final way that people use their Second Brain is for creating new things. They realize that they have a lot of knowledge on a subject and decide to turn it into something concrete and shareable. Seeing so much supporting material ready and waiting gives them the courage to put their own ideas out there and have a positive impact on others.
[2022-06-25 1:31 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/102/2%5Bpage_42%5D%3A0%29)

--------------------

When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive level. Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or potentially useful. Don’t make it an analytical decision, and don’t worry about why exactly it resonates—just look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it’s time to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.
[2022-06-25 1:33 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/136/2%5Bpage_45%5D%3A0%29)

--------------------

Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate. It might take hundreds of pages and thousands of words to fully explain a complex insight, but there is always a way to convey the core message in just a sentence or two.
[2022-06-29 9:30 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/166/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

 Information becomes knowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it’s just a theory.
[2022-06-25 1:39 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/18/2/4/2/188/1%3A59%29)

Chapter 4

Capture—Keep What Resonates
[2022-06-25 1:40 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/2%5Bch04_hd%5D/2%5Bpage_52%5D%3A0%29)

--------------------

A Second Brain gives us a way to filter the information stream and curate only the very best ideas we encounter in a private, trusted place. Think of it as planting your own “knowledge garden” where you are free to cultivate your ideas and develop your own thinking away from the deafening noise of other people’s opinions.
[2022-06-26 12:32 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/14/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

By integrating her notetaking with her daily life, she’s able to use language and analogies that are rooted in everyday feelings and experiences, forging a powerful connection with her fans who call themselves “Swifties.”
[2022-06-26 12:35 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/32/1%3A122%29)

Makes ideation consistent and easy as you're literally learning from livng life

--------------------

Knowledge isn’t always something “out there” that you have to go out and find. It’s everywhere, all around you: buried in the emails in your inbox, hidden within files in your documents folder, and waiting on cloud drives. **Knowledge capture is about mining the richness of the reading you’re already doing and the life you’re already living.**
[2022-06-26 12:36 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/54/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

 A knowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience.
[2022-06-26 12:37 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/56/1%3A297%29)

--------------------

**Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner thoughts.** External knowledge could include:

Highlights: Insightful passages from books or articles you read.
Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to.
Bookmarks and favorites: Links to interesting content you find on the web or favorited social media posts.
Voice memos: Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.”
Meeting notes: Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls.
Images: Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting.
Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended.
[2022-06-26 12:36 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/58/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

As you start collecting this material from the outer world, it often sparks new ideas and realizations in your inner world. You can capture those thoughts too! They could include:

**Stories: Your favorite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else.
Insights: The small (and big) realizations you have.
Memories: Experiences from your life that you don’t want to forget.
Reflections: Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary.
Musings: Random “shower ideas” that pop into your head.**
[2022-06-26 12:37 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/64/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

How could one person make so many contributions across so many areas? How did he have the time to lead such a full and interesting life while also becoming one of the most recognized scientists of his generation?

Feynman revealed his strategy in an interview4:

**You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps**. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”
[2022-06-26 12:42 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/88/1%3A0%29)

--------------------

Ask yourself, “What are the questions I’ve always been interested in?” **This could include grand, sweeping questions like “How can we make society fairer and more equitable?” as well as practical ones like “How can I make it a habit to exercise every day?”** It might include questions about relationships, such as “How can I have closer relationships with the people I love?” or productivity, like “How can I spend more of my time doing high-value work?”

--------------------

How do I live less in the past, and more in the present?
How do I build an investment strategy that is aligned with my mid-term and long-term goals and commitments?
What does it look like to move from mindless consumption to mindful creation?
How can I go to bed early instead of watching shows after the kids go to bed?
How can my industry become more ecologically sustainable while remaining profitable?
How can I work through the fear I have of taking on more responsibility?
How can my school provide more resources for students with special needs?
How do I start reading all the books I already have instead of buying more?
How can I speed up and relax at the same time?
How can we make the healthcare system more responsive to people’s needs?
What can I do to make eating healthy easier?
How can I make decisions with more confidence?

--------------------

The key to this exercise is to make them open-ended questions that don’t necessarily have a single answer. To find questions that invoke a state of wonder and curiosity about the amazing world we live in.
[2022-06-26 12:44 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/112/1%3A265%29)

--------------------

The goal isn’t to definitively answer the question once and for all, but to use the question as a North Star for my learning.

--------------------

Phrase them as open-ended questions that could have multiple answers (in contrast to “yes/no” questions with only one answer).
[2022-06-26 12:45 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c696272655f4c69627261727931/247/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/22/2/4/2/122/8/2%5Bpage_66%5D%3A0%29)

--------------------

Your first instinct might be to save the article in its entirety. It’s high-quality information, so why not preserve all of it? The problem is, it’s an in-depth how-to article that is thousands of words long. Even if you spend the twenty or thirty minutes it would take to consume it now, in the future you’ll just have to spend all that time reading it again, since you’ll have forgotten most of the details. You also don’t want to just bookmark the link and save it to read later, because then you won’t know what it contains in the first place!

This is where most people get stuck. They either dive straight into the first piece of content they see, read it voraciously, but quickly forget all the details, or they open dozens of tabs in their web browser and feel a pang of guilt at all those interesting resources they haven’t been able to get to.

--------------------

 in any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you.

the difference between saving an article and taking notes

--------------------

With a notes app, you can always save links back to the original content if you need to review your sources or want to dive deeper into the details in the future.

--------------------

If you try to save every piece of material you come across, you run the risk of inundating your future self with tons of irrelevant information.

--------------------

There is a way to evoke a sense of inspiration more regularly: keep a collection of inspiring quotes, photos, ideas, and stories. Any time you need a break, a new perspective, or a dash of motivation, you can look through it and see what sparks your imagination.

**If you’re not surprised, then you already knew it at some level, so why take note of it?**

Your Second Brain shouldn’t be just another way of confirming what you already know. We are already surrounded by algorithms that feed us only what we already believe and social networks that continually reinforce what we already think.

“Generation Effect,”10 researchers have found that when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words

--------------------

The most amazing thing about these findings is that they didn’t rely on input from others. No one had to read or respond to what these people wrote down—the benefits came just from the act of writing
