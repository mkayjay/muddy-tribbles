## Reflection
### Summary
Some summary alkdjalksdjalsjdasdas
### Biggest Personal Achievement
Cool personal achievement
### Biggest Career Achievement
Cool career milestone
### Learning Review
**3 great things that happened to me last week were**
- Another consultation session booked
- Asked for an extension for my coop and got it
- Badminton with kuya matmat and others at bonsor

**The main struggle I faced this week was...**
- My daily routines and commitments to myself, barely followed through

**and if I were advising or mentoring someone dealing with the same struggle, I'd advise them to...**
- Drop habitica, and put it where you see it the most, in your Obsidian vault

**2 things I learned about myself this past week include...**
- I have trouble sleeping because I'm not content with how I spent the day
- Spending 8 hours at work is really hindering my ability to create content
	- I think I should save up money, then go full time on content creation for a bit until I run out, then go back to school
		- I'm already making mad progress on <4 hours, but if I were to commit to more then that would be insane

**2 things I learned about others include...**
- Depression is truly unfortunate
- People naturally have way different interests than me

**1 decision I could have made last week to make my life better or to move ahead faster would have been...**
- Getting my own personal work done while at work, or prepping to finish SMS payments
