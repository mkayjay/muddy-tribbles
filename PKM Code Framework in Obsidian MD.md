# PKM Code Framework in Obsidian MD
## Capture
- [[ðŸ“¥ My Inputs]] for external resources
- [[ðŸ’­ My Thoughts]] for internal ideas
- Daily notes for things to process later
	- Consider the workbench plugin if you want a designated note/inbox
## Organize
[[PARA Method in Obsidian MD]] to organize based on actionability
[[Zettelkasten]] and [[Maps of Content (MOC)]] to structure ideas and form connections
[[ðŸŒž My Greenhouse]] to keep track of developing [[Evergreen Notes]]
## Distill
[[Progressive Summarization]] can be done in [[ðŸ“¥ My Inputs]] notes

Consider using the [[Progressive Summarization Checklist Addon]] to keep track of what stage you're at
## Express
[[Retrieving information from your notes]]

Use [[ðŸ’¡ My Brainstorms]] to flesh out ideas and think of their potential use cases. Everyone has widely ranging use cases for Obsidian, so I didn't want to do much in here

I also just personally use Notion workflows as I don't want my vault cluttered with outputs
