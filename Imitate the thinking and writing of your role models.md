# Imitate the thinking and writing of your role models
## Principles
- Imitation helps you personally tap into the mind and perspective of the author, to view things from a worldview other than your own
	- Can adopt and experience the mindset of a roman emperor like Marcus Aurelius, or a billionaire like Elon Musk
	- Imitation causes you to mix their thinking with yours, including their thinking patterns to come to their learnings
	- Explain the their findings with your own personal understanding
		- Personal experiences
		- Other content you consumed
