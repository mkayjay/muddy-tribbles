# Managing projects
## Principles
- Uses the [[Template Explanations#Project Template]]
- Follow the BASB [[Project Workflow Checklists]]
### View Projects
- View all projects at [[ðŸš§ My Projects]]
	- Can also see them in the weekly review
- Instead of having everything grouped in folders, I just have a query in the project note that lists out all notes linked to the project.

If you want actual checklists, feel free to check out the `Tasks` community plugin
### Creating a new project
To create a new project, use hotkey `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Create` -> `Create Project (with Kanban)`

The files you create will then go to the `1. Projects folder`, which you can then group into sub-folders.

After creating, [[Managing tasks via kanbans|add tasks]]
