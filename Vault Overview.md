# Vault Overview
Watch my showcase video on the vault [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bdE_54UUA4)
## Principles
There's a lot of features, plugins, and methodologies inside this vault, and I'm not sure how useful these explanations are from a fresh beginner's perspective. Feel free to fill in the gaps through google, myself, or the discord community :)

If you disabled live preview mode, I highly recommend turning it on to have queries, buttons, and more functions renderred while you're in edit mode. ^531cbd
