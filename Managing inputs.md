# Managing inputs
Inputs are any form of media
## Principles
- Refer to [[My Inputs Workflow]] for an idea on how to use it
### Workflow Inspiration
- [[ðŸ“¥ Konik Method for Making Useful Notes]]
## Inputs List
- [[ðŸ“¥ My Inputs]] is used to keep track of all inputs, but you can create more specific ones for each input type like [[ðŸ“š My Books]]
### Creating Input
- `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open Quickadd -> `Input` -> Choose your input type

### Adding New Input 
ex) [[ðŸ“š My Books]]

- Create a new note for the input
- Copy an already existing one and then change the `#i/{inputType}` in each query to whatever the new input is
	- ex) `#i/podcast` or `#thoughts/musings`

If you're also planning on adding a new template for it:
- Create a new template and add it to the `templates/inputs` folder
- Refer to the [[QuickAdd Plugin]] to add an option for the new input note type
