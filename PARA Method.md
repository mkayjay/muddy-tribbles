# PARA Method
The PARA method helps organize your notes based on actionability, starting from the most actionable (projects) to the least actionable (archived).

- [[PARA Method in Obsidian MD]]
## Framework
### Project
- Series of tasks related to a goal with a deadline
- Create sub-folders to organize each project
### Areas
- Long-term, personal things with no end date
- Includes identities
	- ex) Parent, partner, writer, programmer
- Includes responsibilities
	- ex) Health, finances, friends, car
- Areas will include more personal notes-to-self and thoughts rather than general information that's universal to all
	- Mostly ideas you curate yourself
#### Brainstorming
- Consider formulating your [[12 Favorite Problems]] into areas you want to attend to
### Resources
- Houses the main zettelkasten/linked portion of your notes
- Includes topics and themes of ongoing interest
	- ex) Productivity, social media, personal knowledge management, hobbies (soccer)
- Notes that would also be helpful for other people
- For information you find that may not be useful now but potentially in the future
### Archive
- Inactive items from the other 3 categories
## Tips
- It's okay to have the same concept in 2 roots (areas/health and resources/health), as one will be for personal notes and one will be for general ideas
- Determining Area vs Resource
	- Is it something specific to your situation and curated based on your experiences and thoughts (area), or something general and useful that others can use?
