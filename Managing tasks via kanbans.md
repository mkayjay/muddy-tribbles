# Managing tasks via kanbans
## Principles
*What is a [[Kanban Board|kanban?]]*

View all your kanbans [[ðŸ“ŒMy Kanbans|here]]

### Features
When creating a new kanban card, you can
- Drag kanban cards from one column to another, and into other kanban notes ðŸ¤¯
- Include the date by typing `@` while creating a Kanban, which will automatically link to your daily note and appear in it's [[Daily Template#To Do's]]
	- *This will only happen if the kanban file is in `1. Projects` since that's where the To Do's queries looks for the tasks*
- Create notes from Kanban cards by clicking on the 3 dots
- Reuse other kanban notes by duplicating them
	- Can also maybe have a [[QuickAdd Plugin|quickadd]] choice to select from premade kanban templates
- Archive notes to remove them from finished
	- Can batch archive by clicking on `Finished` list's 3 dots
	- Can still be viewed when viewing the note in markdown
