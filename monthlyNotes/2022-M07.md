### Side Quests
- Solidify whether I want to aim for half-assing an internship for the financial security. I feel like it won't be sustainable though, and I'd feel much more fulfilled just going full time content creation.
	- 60k is enough to live VERY comfortably though, and same with 46k if I spend a fraction of the time working
		- Like even my current salary is too much for me atm
		- Taking a year gap won't be that bad imo, much better than regretting

## Reflection
### Summary
The biggest rut in a whileeeeeee
- Felt lost, but these times of pain can lead to some amazing transformations
### Biggest Personal Achievement
Chat with a LOT of people
- Jasmine
- Andrew and Michael
- Dante
- Ally
- Pearl
### Biggest Career Achievement
Pivot to my new channel branding, finding that big market gap for content.
### Productivity
**Did you complete what you set out to do in the previous review? Are you content?**
- Fleeting notes
	- Did not accomplish much, kept getting stuck with minute things
- Content creation
	- Made todoist video
	- Was able to do channel expansion
	- Did not tweet much but was able to connect with people so its w/e. I need to focus on YouTube as my platform, especially with my new pivot.
	- Got a backlog of videos to create now hehe
- Intentional leisure
	- During the rut phase I ended up doomscrolling hard, but I did introduce more social and games-oriented leisure so I think I was pretty successful
		- Just nee to stick to my 1 hour limit on gaming with kuya matmat though lmao

**What was the completion rate of my projects? Was the workload manageable or was it overwhelming?**
- Manageable but bad headspace.
### My Wins
I managed to...
- Aside from what's listed above:
	- get a glimpse of my nolife mindset again :)
	- Get to apply stoicism while in a fucked headspace
	- Ace Geotab interviews and get interview from SAP
### Gratitude
I'm grateful for...
- Everyone who helped me during my rut.
### Obstacles
I struggled with...
- Overfixation and overvaluing the attention of someone, painting an irrational picture on the potential progress of it. At least I'm much more aware and active towards my neediness now.
- Getting out of the traditional social media rut. I do need to better understand the neuroscience behind dopamine and addictions in a way where I can have a healthy moderation without going overboard like I did this month.

Next time I'll overcome it by...
- Like Michael said, acceptance, the idea of diminishing your desire, even if it means surpressing your ambitious dreams. You can't have them all, and the response of others is not something you can control.
- Just having a lot of things to look forward to work towards. Fleeting Notes, improving Obsidian, my new personal brand, branching out and being able to delegate and study the success of my idols in that niche, I can't fkn wait
### My Learnings
**What is one valuable lesson?**
- Stoicism truly is the antidote to suffering

**What can I improve on in the future month?
- My time management, hopefully akiflow helps me with that hehe

**What should I start/stop doing?**
- Start
	- Delegation
	- Reading again
	- Connecting with people in my new channel pivot
	- Meditation practices
	- Deep diving into channel models
	- Establishing my authority in the Obsidian/PKM/productivity space
	- Prioritizing what's highest leverage
	- Setting harsh deadlines for myself
	- Being consistent
- Stop
	- Mindless media and excessive entertainment
	- Failing my transitions. [[Transitioning Between Environments]]. Ugh this is why I love PKM so much.
