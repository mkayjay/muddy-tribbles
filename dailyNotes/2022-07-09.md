## Reflection
Rating::  9
### Summary
This is what it feels like to submit a non-finished MVP
### Story
Using anime to improve my life (sleep)
### Accomplishments
- Finished vault MVP, ready to send :)
- Wrote weekly wondering 4 newsletter
- Caught up on anime
### Obstacles
- Time as always
	- At least I spent my time very intentionally and well today, no complaints, just need to try and sleep earlier
- Knowing when to declare MVP
	- Always more things to add, it's like im packing the thing as an entire course lmao
### Content Log
- [Andy Matsuchak Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)
	- One year into this and I still find valuable takeaways from his notes
- [Then, Now, and Forever Acrylic Painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTtoFLYb5xY)
	- Interesting to see the depth of meaning people have about the piece in the comments, respect to the artist and for the people appreciating art
- [5 Great Books for Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksImBkJNQt8&ab_channel=BillGates)
	- If only I didn't have a massive backlog already...
	- Why we're polarized sounds good af though
- [David Goggins x Joe Rogan - Listening to music while working out is cheating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lre-OpA-utU&ab_channel=JREClips)
	- Need to learn to equip myself with myself
### Thoughts
David Goggins on self-motivation
- What are you going to do when the external motivation is gone, when the workout music stops and you're left with yourself? Will you continue to thrive with a trained mind, or will you be on your knees crawling for something to numb the pain?

Call of the night ep 1
> Why do you think people stay up at night?
> Because there's a show they want to watch or something they want to do? Or they're worried about tomorrow?
> It's simple. It all boils down to one reason.
> They aren't satisfied with how they spent the day.
- Never heard of this idea before, gave me a direction on how to tackle my sleep insomnia
- Who knew anime could help me with self-improvement lmao
### Energies
**What did I do to re-energize? How did it go?**
- Watched a lot of anime, helped switch context and just have fun :)

Physical:: 7

Emotional:: 10
