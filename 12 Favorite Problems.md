# 12 Favorite Problems
> Read up on Tiago Forte's [3-part series](https://fortelabs.com/blog/series/12-favorite-problems/) on it
## Principles
- Your 12 favorite problems are open-ended questions important to you
- Used to guide use and relevance of information in our [[Personal Knowledge Management MOC]], making sure the things we take notes on stay relevant to what we want to know and accomplish in life
	- Can lead to unorthodox and abstract connections you may not first think of
- Used by Feynman to slowly chip away at large and vast questions
- Example questions
	- ex) “How can we make society fairer and more equitable?”
	- ex) “How can I make it a habit to exercise every day?”

### Application
- Every time you consume content, test it with each question
