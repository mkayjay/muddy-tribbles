# Capturing information
## Principles
- Aim for 10-20% retention from each previous layer
- Highlight only when you're about to use, not after consumption
	- Assume notes you take will be useless
	- Be conservative
	- Each time you visit, make it more discoverable for the future
		- Modify highlight, heading, bullets, commentary, etc
### Criteria
When you're about to highlight something, ask yourself:
- Does it inspire me?
- Is it useful?
- Is it personal?
	- Such insights are unique to your own identity and thought process
- Is it surprising?
	- Don't take notes of things you already know
### Practices
- Take [[Fleeting Notes]] whenever you have something memorable to note down during life's daily events
