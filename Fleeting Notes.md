# Fleeting Notes
## Principles
Fleeting notes are one of the three types of notes in the Zettelkasten ideology.

Whenever you have an idea, you MUST have an easy way to capture it into a fleeting note, or else you might risk losing it.

To help remind us of ideas throughout the day, we can use fleeting notes to remind ourselves of these thoughts for future processing.

### A good fleeting notes system
Your system/workflow to take fleeting notes should satisfy the following three criteria, with the [[Fleeting Notes App]] as a comparison example:

#### Effortless
The harder it is to capture an idea, the less likely you will capture it.

Fortunately, fleeting notes lets you capture ideas in two clicks.
#### Speed and Accessiblity
Obsidian is a great permanent knowledge base, but it's too slow and inaccessible for fleeting notes.

Especially if you have a lot of notes like me, where Obsidian can take over a minute to load on your phone.

The longer it takes to capture an idea, the more likely you will forget the essence of it.

Fleeting Notes is supported on various different platforms to help you take notes in any scenario.
#### Processability
It should be easy to turn your fleeting notes into permanent notes in your PKM system.

With the fleeting notes Obsidian plugin, you can automatically sync your [[Fleeting Notes App|fleeting notes]] into your vault.

With customizable templates, you can creatively structure these packets of information.
