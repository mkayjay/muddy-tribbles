	- **Knowledge becomes more powerful as it spreads.**
- Self-awareness
	- **Every external idea is like a mirror, surfacing within us the truths and the stories that want to be told.**
	- **discovering the tacit knowledge that lives within you. Itâ€™s in there, but you need external hooks to pull it out
- Self-expression
	-  **The world is desperate to hear what you know. You can change lives by sharing yourself with others.**
