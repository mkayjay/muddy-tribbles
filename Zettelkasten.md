# Zettelkasten
[Zettelkasten Starter's Guide](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)

A zettelkasten allows us to have a permanent foundation of knowledge, allowing us to spend more time thinking rather than recalling information.
## Benefits
- A zettelkasten cannot think and understand things for us, it is only to organize our ideas and make connections
	- A zettelkasten does all the storing so we can think creatively
-  Develop topics
- Make creative connections
- Compare and alter previous notes
- Assemble a toolbox for thinking
- Creativity machine
	- Innovation derives from small, incremental steps that add up
## Quotes
>  “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 142)
