# Showing inline titles
Right now, on note creation I set the main header of the note as the title given.

However, In Obsidian v1.0, you can now see the title of the note as an inline title, making adding the title using Templater into the note redundant.

If you want to start using inline, you'll have to remove all instances of `# <%tp.file.title%>` in all template notes, and you'll have to enable it in the settings (Settings > Appearance > `show inline title`)

If I didn't already have thousands of notes with them, I would personally have it enabled to keep embedded notes clean.
