# Managing thoughts and ideas
## Principles
Whenever I have a thought, I either add it to [[Daily Template#Thoughts]] if it's something miniscule to which I can choose to turn it into a [[Thought Template]] note at the end of the day

Beyond the tags in [[ðŸ’­ My Thoughts]], I also add more depth in case I decide to look at related thoughts, like `#thoughts/memories/work`
